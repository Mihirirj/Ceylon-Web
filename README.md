# CeylonWeb - Multi-Language React Showcase


 This project is a demonstration of a modern, multi-language React application built with Vite, showcasing internationalization (i18n) capabilities using `react-i18next`. The application supports English, Sinhala (‡∑É‡∑í‡∂Ç‡∑Ñ‡∂Ω), and Tamil (‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æ¥‡Øç) languages, allowing users to dynamically switch content.

The project aims to illustrate a clean, component-based architecture, responsive design, and a professional UI with a subtle Sri Lankan theme. It's designed to be a portfolio piece demonstrating skills in React, modern JavaScript, localization, and front-end styling.
